            Hi Riya <br />
            There are no words that do justice to the amount of happiness you have brought into my life.<br />
            Every day i am excited to read the good morning message from you, i look forward to every new day.
            Soon good morning texts would be redundant, we will be waking up together. And i am beyond excited for that
            day.
            Last three months have felt like a dream. We have faced highs and lows together and you have been there for
            all of them.
            We have shared moments, hopes, dreams , stories of sadness and despair, as well as hope and brightness with
            each other.
            From lying on a bed for an entire day in each other's arms to roaming around the city on a shitty bike, i
            have enjoyed each and every moment with you.<br />
            Looking forward to making many more memories, facing hardships, enjoying the highs and fighting through the
            lows.<br />
            We got this sunshine❤️
